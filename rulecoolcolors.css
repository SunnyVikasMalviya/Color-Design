/*The "pure" color is set with the Hue. This is expressed as the angle in degrees around the color wheel.
Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of that hue. Colors with full saturation (100%) are the color itself, colors with no saturation (0%) are completely grayscale.
Lightness refers to the lightness of the color. 0% is black, 100% is white.
A, or alpha, refers to the opacity. 0% is fully transparent, 100% is fully opaque.*/
